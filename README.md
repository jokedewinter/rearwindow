#Rear Window
An experiment with a hero image block with clickable areas. Each area shows some information on click.

[View Demo](http://jokedewinter.github.io/rearwindow/)

* CSS only, using :target to show the information.
* Narrow viewports shows buttons for each piece of information.

##To do:

* Improve the narrow viewport experience. Maybe turn it into a flick through card type of thing.
* Add some JavaScript to enhance the click experience on wider viewports. Or maybe some CSS transitions.
